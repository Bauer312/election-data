# Election-Data

I have a project I've been working on that requires me to put election results into a database.  I've done a little bit of searching and to my surprise I was unable to find data in a format that is easily importable - or at least in the way that I wanted to import it.  So, I had to create it.  Hopefully you find this data to be useful for your own projects.



## Contributing

I would love to have more historical data.  If you can add past years, please submit them via a pull request.  I have chosen to represent the data files in UTF-8 format and would appreciate submitted files to conform.

If you find an error in the data, please notify me and/or submit a fix via a pull request.  Even something so small as the spelling of a name is worth fixing.
